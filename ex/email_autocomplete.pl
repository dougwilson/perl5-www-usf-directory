=head1 NAME

email_autocomplete.pl - Example USF directory e-mail autocompletion.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001

=head1 USAGE

  email_autocomplete.pl q="<thing to complete>"

      Running the file directly as a script, you can specify q=value
      parameter and CGI output will be given with the search result.
      The ideal use is to place this in your cgi-bin and access it by
      /cgi-bin/email_autocomplete.pl?q=name%20to%20complete

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an example CGI script that will take a name to search for in the
query string and return a JSON-encoded response with the results (or error).

=head1 OPTIONS

This takes name-value pairs seperated by an equal sign C<=> and maps that
to query string name-value pairs.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This script utilizes L<CGI::Application> and thus all diagnostics are up
to that module.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Normal exist status will always be C<0> unless a required Perl module
(listed in L</DEPENDENCIES>) is not found.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

There are no configuration options for this script.
